# Design pattern samples in Java.

This is the branch for the pages.

## The website reference

Due to the fact that we use git submodules, the website normally
wouldn't automatically update with the changes in the master branch.

To enable the automatic update of the submodule reference we use
the [update-ghpages.sh](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/blob/master/update-ghpages.sh)
script in the master branch together with Travis-CI.
